    <h1>Just know that I still want to play with you. I like playing with you, honest to god, but I know me saying it on it's own isn't gonna make your doubt go away. If you're okay with me joining you, know that I'll be out in the afternoon so I can either get on in the morning or somewhere probably around 6 and after. Hopefully over time I can make your doubt go away. </h1>
    <h1>I'm sorry</h1>
